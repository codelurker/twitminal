There is aproblem on my machine detecting the local deviation from GMT, strftime with %z is empty here, so i had to put it -0430 in code ( for caracas), you must change it for whatever your zone is

open checker.py 
edit self.last = d.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S -0430")
change -0430 for whatever timezone you are in.


There is a problem with non ASCII characters, it seems that twitter api throws an exception with this.

Any fixes for this would be appreciated.

THANK YOU to the twitter python api team, and of course simplejson and growl team.
